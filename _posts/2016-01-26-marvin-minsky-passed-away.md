Much of engineering and programming is about solving puzzles, learning and making discoveries. That there are many emotions (like joy, fun, awe, pain, surprise) in thinking were one of the lessons prof. Minsky taught me. And, it was one of the ideas of starting my blog "[thinking_on thinking](http://hinkingonthinking.com)".

*The Society of Mind lecture by Prof. Marvin Minsky at MIT on OpenCourseWare*

It was very sad news to hear that Marvin Minsky passed away. In honour to prof. Minsky, I want to share some email exchanges we had:

## 2003 

My first email to Marvin when I was studying semiconductors:

Dear Prof. Minsky,

lately I was thinking that computing systems can never
be "intelligent" (I haven't thought about a definition
of intelligence yet, but I mean the function of
solving problems autonomously). As far as I understand
VLSI systems, they are all finite state machines.


> Brain are finite-state machines, too.  So far as present-day physics can say.


That kept me thinking and I had to ask more questions. I was wondering what the
evolutionary reason was, that humans have a certain
number of neuron cells.

For example, an Intel Pentium processor has around 400 milion
transistors (90nm gate length). Moore's Law is predicting several billions
transistors in some years. At the moment the biggest
bottleneck is seen in the power consumption (=heat
production). Do you know if there is a similar problem
for the human brain?

I am still busy in reading some of your work from your
homepage... I think there will many question popup.
Just one last remark, I have read your article about
[music and meaning](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/MusicMindMeaning.html). I found there were extremely
interesting thoughts in it.

ps: I have recently read the book of Bertrand Russel
"Problems of Philosophy". Do you have suggestions of
other books where perception of things/reality is
examined ?

## 2004

Then, I started reading more about symbol processing in our nervous system. Not sure if this message came via a newsgroup.

## 2006

Then, in 2006 I reflected about moving to Boston to study computers at the Media Lab. Still, moving from Germany to the US would be quite some jump for me at that time. Here is some resasoning of Marvin.

> Well, it was not necessary to travel, because I was in the right place at the right time. When I was in college in the late 1940s, some of the greatest mathematicians in the world had already come to Harvard, as refugees from Europe and World War II. Then when I went to Princeton in 1950,  I had the opportunity to work with von Neumann and other great mathematicians, as well as physicists like Oppenheimer.  I did not get interested in logic until later, and never liked it much because I recognized that most reasoning involves analogies, which no logical systems can handle well.
 
I also asked questions on music, what I was listening at that time:

> I like Scarlatti's ideas enough, but prefer to be guided by Beethoven and Bach, because they show how to think several thoughts at once.

And about traveling in general:

> As for visiting countries, I don't much like cultures, because each of them only shows different mistakes.  To me, only the culture of Science shows progress.



## 2008

The last email conversation:

I recently learnt about values within "teams" and how they
prevent on developing individual views:

> Interesting issue: does teaching "cooperation" conflict with learning to develop one's own ideas?

For example:

* Jonathan Haidt [the moral mind](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html)
* [YourMorals](http://www.yourmorals.org/explore.php)

> I couldn't quickly extract a clear idea from these. Does Jonathan Haidt have a good paper on this?

I did not understand too much how to dig for papers in social sciences at that time. But I liked to asked more questions about books in general. Also about writing.

So I asked: It is not possible to regularly order your first book on computers.
Are there plans to re-publish the book? Do you have it as PDF or text?

> Yes, I'll try to republish it.  I encountered resistance, the last time I tried, because publishers insisted on something new.  But I wrote it so that it would never be outdated!

* I have your book on Perceptrons. Does topology play a role in modern
computers?  How can it teach us to make better abstractions?

From these conversations, I learnt how important it can be to ask questions and how to search for new answers. These are the origins of my blog [thinkingonthinking](http://thinkingonthiking.com]
