No doubt, the world is changing. In a world with global supply-chain networks, computers and robots, how valid are theories of division of labor? In a world, that is shaped by Utilitarianism, what value can arts and aesthetics add?

These questions came to mind when entering the Venice Biennale 2015 curated by Okui Enwezor. Before entering the exhibition, we are reminded: "Blues Blood Bruise".

Exploiting humans as slaves was common before the first industrial revolution (and still today in some countries). The first rooms in the exhibition explore these phenomenon of slavery. We are faced with the "end" of humans, societies and ideas in many ways. We'll learn that "laws" of capitalism might have deeper roots in human nature. 

Humans become refugees in the hope of a better life. The Mediterranean sea, once flourishing in trade and mixing cultures, has become a border from first world to 3rd world. Yet, the hidden forces of capitalism drives people to risk their lives in search for a "better" life.

When they arrive in the new world, what do they see? How can they identify themselves in a new world? It is here, where we stop having a "western" culture. It is also where industrialization stops.

Let's see what thoughts tomorrow brings.
