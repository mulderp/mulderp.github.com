How amazing to experience a conference at the borders of design, art and technology. It was especially fascinating to merge with the flow of the speakers and the audience , who are driven by ideas on design and innovation. Here, 8 hours of talks feel like 10 seconds, and coming home, you feel full of energy to work on new ideas.

For me, one of the most inspiring message was about play, discovery and learning. The speakers showed a lot of impressing works and photographs, but also shared some of their failings. 

A notable talk came from the [field design agency](http://www.field.io). At the beginning of the talk, the speaker mentioned that ideas from art, design and theory would be discussed. Interesting, because when you enter a certain daily routine in your life, words like "theory" or "art" are not often used. "Design" is used sometimes, but not so much in the sense of understanding and discovery, but more as an instrument to hide costs or emotions.

The original goal of the talk by field.io is nicely summarized on the [conference website](http://push-conference.com/2013/speakers/field/) However, a lot of personal experiences came to light that happen when you work on something new and creative. And especially interesting, the speaker mentioned strategies to cope with failure and the outside perception of the creative process.

Audiences of digital products almost never have a good feeling what they want. Therefore, design process is about inquiry. However, inquiry is not be measured in weeks, rather months or years. That is why we need to have long-term goals, they are our personal frameworks to question the world and guide our ambitions. At the same time, asking the same questions over and over again, finding new variations in existing answers, might exactly be the output that we get paid for as creative workers, as software developers or artists. 

Thanks, Markus Wendt for an amazing talk, and the push conference team for an amazing conference!
