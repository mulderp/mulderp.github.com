 an example of how a user story might look as strip
 the original idea was here: http://www.google.de/googlebooks/chrome/

what I see as some small evolution
you remember how looked like 10y ago user stories

 he has written a book on the topic
 comics should rule the world :)

cool I will have dfo look at that
 but that's for the high end board level
 maybe… not sure…. people think comics are funny, so the feedback is not so impressive yet
 ah, there is a ted talk too http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_mccloud_on_comics.html
 well, the more I think of it, the more I like this… well, almost end-of-day :)
