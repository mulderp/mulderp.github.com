Lately, I was reflecting why I had studied engineering, ano not art or design. Actually, I had studied mathematics for some time, which can be seen as a form of design and art too.  

My conclusion is, that I enjoy the products of engineering: Their function, and in some cases the emotional rewards that certain products bring. In the case of electronic engineering, I mostly enjoyed music and sound processing devices. A bit different kind of product I always enjoyed were communication devices, like radio or modems for communication via computers. The web revolutionized all communication devices, and fascination with products from Philips or Sony turned into fascination of products from Apple and Unix.

Making good products requires some kind of philosophy or culture. It is difficult to say how ti works, but for sure products are just mirror the context were they were created. Good products also involve a lot of design thinking, looking at humans from different angels, and filtering certain aspects from our senses, how we feel or see things, or how we "experience" things.

And here the circle goes round: Culture and design are based on communication. Good products are based on communication. It is here where I want to try out something new: A newsfeed for sharing ideas on product design. Since I suspect most product design to take place in a startup environment, I want to dedicate the site Munich Technology Partners to startups too: [mtpartners.de](http://mtpartners.de)
