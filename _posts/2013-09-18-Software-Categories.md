Ruby-on-Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, Djano are examples of web frameworks. Sinatra (or Rack), SASS, Backbone.js are examples of libraries. Frameworks often feel great at the start because of the high productivity, libraries on the contrary provide different answers to solving software problems.

As Ruby-on-Rails creater David Heinemeier Hansson explains in [this video](http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson): "Rails started as an application, it never started as [the framework] Rails. It started as me wanting to build Basecamp. ... and I found a need to build a bunch of tools."

The distinction between a toolset (framework) and some tool (library) is not so easy, as Andrzej discusses in [What is a framework?](http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.de/2012/12/what-is-framework.html). It is even more difficult to understand when to use a framework, or when to start software development with basic libraries.

An important difference between using a framework and a library is productivity. But productivity is relative. For example, with Twitter Bootstrap, how would you use the grid layout without using 'span' tags all across the page? Or with Rails, how would you develop a Rails application without just for data or with a polyglot mdatabase stack?

Altough the distinction between framework and library is vague, the end-goal for software is not. Software should be designed for others to use. As long as your users are facing standard problems, "frameworks" are fine. But from business strategy, it might be important to look at non-standard problems that only can be addressed by using libraries.
