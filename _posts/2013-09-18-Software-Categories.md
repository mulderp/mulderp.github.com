Ruby-on-Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, Django are examples of web frameworks. Sinatra (or Rack), Compass, Backbone.js are examples of libraries. Frameworks can bring high productivity, using libraries on the contrary, feels slow and require more practice to get started.

Frameworks can grow out of libraries, as Ruby-on-Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson explains in [this video](http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson): "Rails started as an application, it never started as [the framework] Rails. It started as me wanting to build Basecamp. ... and I found a need to build a bunch of tools."

Yet where to draw the line between a toolset (framework) and some tool (library) is not so easy, as Andrzej discusses in [What is a framework?](http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.de/2012/12/what-is-framework.html). It is even more difficult to understand productivity in software development, and the influence from frameworks or libraries.

Productivity is relative. For example, with Twitter Bootstrap, how would you use parts of the responsive grid layout without using 'span' tags all across the page? Or with Rails, how would you develop a Rails application just for data or to provide a polyglot database stack?

Although the distinction between framework and library can be vague, the end-goal for software is not. Software should be designed for others to use. As long as your users are facing standard problems, starting out with "frameworks" is fine. But from business strategy, it might be important to look at non-standard problems that only can be addressed by using libraries. Instead of managing ever increasing toolsets, it can be very profitable to build new kinds of tools. Ask 37signals.
