In the lean startup circle there was recently a discussion on how small companies can actually have enough resources to experiment with a business model. As a software developer with [sideprojects](....), I think this question applies even more. How can let's say 1-2 persons, who work as full-time employees, actually generate viable options for future products or businesses? Strangely, a look at the world of fashion may give some ideas.

* The first core idea is about prototyping and design. In general, it's hard to to explain what prototyping is. Prototyping is more about how something works, rather than what was initially defined. When a picture is worth a thousands words, a prototype is worth a thousand pictures. The important thing on a prototype is that it quickly tells you how an idea can look, how it feels and why you could like it. In the [fashion pyramid](http://www.fashionindie.com/runway-to-red-carpet-in-armani-prive-haute-couture/), prototyping is about what happens at the top of the pyramid. It's about handcrafting and materializing an idea. But it is also about providing ideas to a whole industrial branch, since the memes that are shown on runways easily spread through magazines and television shows, and blogs nowadays. In business models, prototyping is about learning what works for 1 or 2 customers, for 100 men or women, for a cultural region, or for a contintent. (Another example: Some companies seem to run prototypes of a business in Canada first, and scale them in a second phase in USA)

* The second point on what entrepreneurs might learn from fashion designers came to my mind, by looking at this videa by Seth Godin: [How your ideas spread]". In this video, he mentions how Jeff Koons or Frank Loyd became so successful. He also mentions, that sliced bread (with nice patents, and well-thought out bakery process) got unnoticed for 15 years, and became only successful by having a company applying the right marketing techniques. His message is about looking at fashion, because fashion is all about making products 'remarkable'. It's actually this what makes up the customer relationship and sales channel part in the business model canvas. It's about how I feel, when I touch a service, a shop or a product. It's providing the right options to buy a product, or subscribe to a service. 

## Conclusions
Here are some conclusions:

* Business models don't need a lot of resources to experiment with. That's the whole point of building prototypes. Fast, cheap and throw-away models.

* A prototype might be seen as standing at the top of your fashion pyramid. It's about making something unique and special, that can be simplified later on. Like in haute-couture fashion, there are companies specializing in bringing prototypes to the world; however, a whole lot profitable luxury fashion lines do both: Haute-couture and High-end retail. And besides, there is space for volume and mass market segments.

* A business model is not just a product and a customer. Like in fashion, it's about how you feel in a shop, are received by a nice sales person, get extras and feel special. That is the sales channel and customer relationship part in a business model.
