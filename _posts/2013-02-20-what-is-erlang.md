title: What is Erlang?
tags: erlang

I was lucky that there was an [Erlang Factory] conference hosted yesterday in Munich. As programmers whom I think are great (e.g. Adam Wiggins, co-founder of Heroku in [this article|(http://adam.heroku.com/past/2009/9/28/background_jobs_with_rabbitmq_and_minion/) and [Jose Valim](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2011/03/why-rubyists-should-try-elixir/), talked about Erlang e.g. here and here, I was interested in listening from the speakers, what Erlang is and how it works.
