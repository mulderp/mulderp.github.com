The [Fluent conference 2014](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014) is around the corner. This will give nice options to discuss the web, digital interfaces and products. And [San Francisco](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=san+francisco&l=deriv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1) is among the world top places to do this.

So, if you want to spend some time with me in San Francisco (from 8th-14th of March), I can help you with your ideas, and learn from yours. Here are some topics of interests:

## We are knowledge workers

The idea of "happiness at work" may sound like a luxury problem, but providing the right context, meaning and recognition for developing software will transform the way we work. [Christian Heilmann](http://twitter.com/codepo8) from Mozilla gave a great talk on this [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHt3L5Lqs50).

We could explore these questions:

* Do you work with (open-source) software, Photoshop, web services for a living? How do you learn about users and markets? Maybe we can learn together about what makes software product [elegant](http://thinkingonthinking.com/Elegance-in-a-software-business/).
* Maybe you are freelancer too. How do you manage a project pipeline and relationships with your customers?
* I have been looking into representing [flow](http://thinkingonthinking.com/skill-bars/) and skills. The semantics for a skill language are still developing, but it would be great to listen how you sell and buy skills. And, how do digital product help you?
* My motivation to transform the way we work is an investment in [voki.me](http://voki.me). Together with [Andrea Notari](http://twitter.com/andrewnotari) from Milan, Italy, we envision an Airbnb for sharing know-how on digital projects.

Let's connect about the way we work, what is working, and what we are still missing. Let's learn together what we need to know to improve digital work and happiness.

## Dashboard and interfaces

I really enjoy building interfaces in web browsers. Especially, I am a fan of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). The [philosophy of Backbone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4udR30JYenA&feature=youtu.be&t=43m8s) around simplicity and decoupling state and behavior is great.

* As I wanted to learn and explore Backbone.js, I decided to [document my experiences](http://thinkingonthinking.com/writing-on-ruby-and-backbone/) in form of [a book](http://thinkingonthinking.com/writing-a-book/), which is just about to be finished. The main topics of the book can already be seen on the book website: [The Pipefish Book](http://pipefishbook.com).
* I gave talks about [delivering client-side applications](https://speakerdeck.com/mulderp/the-client-side-on-ruby) and [the MV* pattern with Thorax](https://speakerdeck.com/mulderp/from-backbone-to-thorax).
* Maybe we can discuss ideas about building web interfaces? Let me show you how to work with Backbone.js or Thorax, while it would be great to learn and see how much it applies your use cases.

## Web services

* The idea "backend as a service" ([nobackend.org](http://nobackend.org/)) sounds interesting. In some ways, it is what Amazon S3 offers already today. I can help you here. Would you like to setup some hosting static content, such as images or static web applications?
* I could also show you how to build an API with Ruby or Node.js, maybe using a NoSQL data store such as Redis or [ArangoDB](http://arangodb.org). We would touch the concept of JavaScript promises. and how we easily can enable parallel computing within threads.
* Or, let's work together and discuss ideas other requirements on distributed systems, such as message queues for connecting APIs?

When I return from San Francisco, I will do project work most likely in Berlin or Munich. What will you be doing?
