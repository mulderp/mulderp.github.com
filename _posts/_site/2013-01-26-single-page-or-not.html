<p>title: What is modular code?</p>

<h2 id='layout_post'>layout: post</h2>

<p>Designing the architecture of a web application is difficult. First, there are many different programming languages among which to chose, then there are many frameworks , some leave design decisions to the programmer, some come &#8220;opinionated&#8217; (= with default settings/strategies). Additionally, within each framework, a number of plugins exists that often solve similar problems, yet have different solution approaches.</p>

<p>In order to help system designers to make decisions, programmers talk about applying &#8220;patterns&#8221; or using a &#8220;pattern language&#8221;. Patterns give some heuristics, whether a system composition makes sense, or will be risky in the future. In my view, a number of patterns are driven by making code and systems modular, a concept that I read in a book some years ago. Modular code (and data) should be easier to re-use, and allow to extend and adapt ideas where needed.</p>

<p>Now, here is an overview of modular design decisions (and experiments) in the context of Ruby and JavaScript for a web application, that would be able to deal with a number of different (mobile) use cases in the future.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<h2 id='clientserver_separation'>Client/Server Separation</h2>

<p>This is the separation of frontend and backend code (although Rails and Node.JS communities show that this separation can be fluent). Sinatra, Rails-API, Rake-API (where I wrote some ideas in this blog post)</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2 id='mvc_on_the_clientside'>MVC on the client-side</h2>

<p>So, far in Backbone, my application structure starts to look as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>app.js main.js</p>

<p>/collections /models /views</p>

<p>How do we see, it&#8217;s MVC? Why do we see it&#8217;s MVC?</p>

<p>MVC pattern helps to guide in the design of computer interaction. It&#8217;ls like the OSI abstraction layers, Publish-Subscriber Pattern one of the important pillars in web technology today.</p>
