Two weeks ago at the [MCSM Modelbauclub](http://www.modellbauclub-mcsm.de/Munich-Maker-Space), I broke the 3D printer. Well, I damaged the printing plate by messing up the calibration of the printing head. Luckily, last week we could repair the damage, but it took some time. 

It is no surprise hat with hardware things can break, with software you can just restart the computer. This makes the feeling of developing hardware a bit different from the software development experience. For hardware, gaining a feeling beforehand (either by being told or by simulation), can influence a lot the outcome. At MCSM, there are a number of retired engineers with many years of engineering experience. It is interesting to see how they have a feeling for a construction and patience to prepare a construction.

In a way, the feeling of breaking things and failure can again be some motivation for future work, as Jack Ma puts it nicely in this interview:
