title: Building Digital Hardware
---
In 2014, there was the first [Oreilly SolidCon](http://conferences.oreilly.com/solid/solid2014) about the impact of the "digital" world on the "digital". Especially, this talk by prof. Neil Gershenfield from the MIT center for bits and atoms captures the concepts and ideas of digital fabrication:

It is an interesting question: What happens if you mix _materials_ with code, symbols and data? In fact, what happens if you replace analog processes for fabrication of goods with digital abstractions to build things? 

As Neil Gershenfield explains, these questions have led to the so-called fablabs or "Fabrication Labs". In Fablabs, people use digital designs from the internet and make physical objects out of it. Often, 3D printers or laser cutters are used. It is amazing to see how blueprints and designs are moving freely over the internet. And, it is equally amazing to see how skills and know-how evolve in maker spaces with blueprints coming from the web and open technologies.

If you have not yet been to a maker space before, here are some starting points.

# Maker spaces

In Munich there are several maker spaces: 

* There is [FabLab Muenchen](http://www.fablab-muenchen.de/) with many workshops for kids and a nice collection of 3D Printers. 
* Then there is [MunichMakerLab](https://munichmakerlab.de/) which has 3D Printers, a laser cutter, drones, and much more. It also hosts meetups for 3D Printing and Arduino for example.
* Then there is the [MCSM Model Engines Club](http://hackaday.com/2014/11/17/because-you-cant-go-to-germany-without-seeing-model-trains/). This is more of a shared workshop in essence, but it comes close to the idea of maker space. By the way, that space just moved into a building 200m away from the Intel HQ in Germany. 
* Last but not least, there is the [Munich office of the Chaos Computer Club](http://wiki.muc.ccc.de/mww:start) which comes close to the idea of maker space too.

In a maker space, you not only will find people to share ideas and solutions to problems. Often, you have access to materials and components for making things. For example, as I am working on a power supply for a robot with screws and cables that the MCSM space provides:

Working with software, the skills and tools needed to build hardware are often easier to pick up in a maker space. 
While a maker space provides tools for analog and digital fabrication, you can explore the web for projects.

# Blueprints from the Web

Sharing hardware and circuits is still a bit different from sharing code. For example, you can easily share JavaScript libraries over [Github](http://github.com) or [NPM](http://npmjs.com). On those platforms, you will also find plenty of code related to hardware. But where do you go for circuits or prototype hardware projects from others?

For sharing blueprints of hardware prototypes, the [Hackster.io](http://hackster.io) platform is interesting. For example, take a look at this [automatic cat feeder](https://www.hackster.io/ifoundthemeaningoflife/texting-automatic-cat-feeder-internet-o-tron-20076e) project by [@SelkeyMoonbeam](https://twitter.com/SelkeyMoonbeam). You will find an overview about used technologies, and most interestingly, you can access the parts inventory for the projects and sometimes a "toolbox".

When it comes to circuits, you can browse printed-circuit boards at [OSHpark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects) for example. With a press of a button, you can easily share design efforts and explore a circuit from someone else. Sharing circuits is still in its early days. 

Another option to build circuits is by the [toner heat transfer method](https://youtu.be/ZY9W-NIHMLA). With this, you print out the circuit on a plastic or paper and transfer it to a copper plate.

For robots, Github is also an interesting platform for collaboration. For example, the [Sumobot](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr) project allows you to build a small robot with an Arduino for less than 50 USD.
