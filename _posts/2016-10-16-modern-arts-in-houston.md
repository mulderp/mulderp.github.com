Recently I had the luck to visit Houston. Maybe you are curious to hear about arts in Houston, as I was?

My arts tour started in the [Houston museum district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Museum_District). There is "CAMH", the [Museum for Contemporary Arts Houston](http://camh.org/) where some Houston based artists were on show. First, I saw paintings and sculptures by [Thedra Cullar-Ledford](http://www.independenceartstudios.com/thedra/artists-statement). Thedra Cullar-Ledford was diagnosed with cancer in 2013. Her pieces tell a story of battles with therapies and tumors, but also about genders, identity and sexuality. As Houston is a center for cancer research, her pieces could communicate more than what goes on behind research and hospitals.

A bit different stories were told by [Susie Rosmarin](Susie Rosmarin). Form should follow function in good design.. In Rosmarin's pieces, the function is taken out again from signals and pixels. All we are left with are [patterns and colors](http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/100-creatives-susie-rosmarin-6397858). While her work is analog, I found it interesting to reflect on her ideas for digital worlds as well. 

From the CAMH, my tour continued to the [Menil Collection](https://www.menil.org/). The impressive building was designed by [Renzo Piano](http://www.rpbw.com/project/25/the-menil-collection/). Unfortunately, Mondays' and Tuesdays' the main collection is closed. All I could visit was the [Rothko Chapel](http://www.rothkochapel.org/).

The Rothko Chapel is very special though. It is one of the few places I know where all religions can meet. It feels warm and calm to connect with other cultures through aesthetics.

Leaving the Rothko Chapel, I moved on to the [Gremillion Gallery](http://www.gremillion.com/thomaszitzwitz/) to see works of an artist friend from Germany: [Thomas Zitzwitz](http://www.zitzwitz.com/). As a trained computer scientist and artist, Thomas's work provides interesting views on abstract art and the nature of light. At Gremillion's I also got an interesting overview about appreciation of modern art in Texas. While Houston can be seen as the center, it should be well worth to visit the [Fort Worth Modern Art museum](http://www.themodern.org/). The building by Tadao Ando as been titled as the ["World's most beautiful art museum"](http://www.themodern.org/about-modern/building).

Well, talking about building and arts installation, my tour ended at [Skyspace](http://skyspace.rice.edu/) by James Turrell.

As the name suggest, a [sky space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyspace) invites you to look at the sky and enjoy the light. This is another example how arts can give you inner peace and happiness.

The word Texas, which means "friends" in the Caddo language (from "Tejas") certainly made a good impression on me. Thank you for being so open and friendly!
