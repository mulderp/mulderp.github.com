One of the most heard question as freelancer is: What are your skills? How can we look at the skills question?

Let's briefly explore some ideas.

According to [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), the way how we apply our skills to problems defines how we experience work. This is a bit complicated, but the main idea is, if the problems that you tackle match your skills, you experience so-called "flow". If the challenge levels are much higher than our skills, we experience anxiety, and if we are much more skilled, than the problems at hand, we feel bored.

So, simply representing skills in bar charts, as is often seen in [infographical resumes](http://dribbble.com/shots/458231-Infographic-Resume), misses something. At least, let's play with an idea how to represent both skills ("what can I do?") and challenge ("what do I want to do?").

We can start with simple skill bars. In [my case](http://patrick.mtpartners.de), these look like:
