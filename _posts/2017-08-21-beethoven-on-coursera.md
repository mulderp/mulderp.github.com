The last months passed by quickly. Over the summer I was reading some books: 

* ["Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25602451-losing-the-signal): This book is about the history of BlackBerry. One of the company's founder [Mike Lazaridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lazaridis) had access to an early version of [Mobitex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobitex) - the predecessors of wireless data networks. The book is a very good overview about the beginnings and developments of mobile data networks in the 90ies: Paging, Motorola and US Robotics a popular modem provider.  The history of BlackBerry also shows the impact of data networks on the evolution of mobile devices.

* ["Joseph Fourier by Joseph Arago"]:  For electronic communication, we look at signals in two different ways: In "time-domain" or "frequency-domain". The mathematical foundations for these perspectives were discovered by Joseph Fourier. I hoped to learn more on the origins of the mathematics. Therefore, I read the Fourier biography. Interestingly, not much of mathematics was discussed in the book by ]Joseph Arago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Arago). Instead, it was surprising that Fourier traveled to Egypt  and reflected about the mechanisms of heat for some years. Thereby discovering the "greenhouse effect" in 1824 (e.g. see [Scientific Americam](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/why-we-know-about-the-greenhouse-gas-effect/) ). 

* ["Tools of the Titans"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31823677-tools-of-titans): I discovered this book by Tim Ferris because it was on the NYTimes bestseller's list 2017. Also, I've heard about Tim Ferris before. Ferris' based this book on Ben Franklin's quote: "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise." So, the book indeed makes you aware that extreme characters wake up earlier, focus better and tolerate more their weaknesses (and use them wisely). The book is also interesting with respect to creative writing and probably my motivation for this blog post.

Well, I started some more books and other things. But right now, I am most fascinated by some coursers on Coursera, esp. the [Beethoven Sonata Lecture by Jonathan Bliss](https://www.coursera.org/learn/beethoven-piano-sonatas/lecture/E2dNG/re-shaping-the-sonata-op-26). there are so many interesting puzzles and ideas in classical music. And audio is full of mathematics too, as well as circuits and hardware, as well as software (and a bit of Fourier analysis).
